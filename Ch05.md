# Chapter 5. APIs and Access



- Namespaces
- Versions: alpha, beta and stable



The entiere Kubernetes architecture is API-driven, the main agent for communication (internal and external) is the Kubernetes-apiserver. There are API groups that may have multiple versions and follow a domain-name format with reserved names such as the empty group and names ending in `.k8s.io`.

View the API groups with a `curl` query:

```json
$ curl https://127.0.0.1:6443/apis -k
....
    {
      "name": "apps",
      "versions": [
        {
          "groupVersion": "apps/v1beta1",
          "version": "v1beta1" 
        },
        {
          "groupVersion": "apps/v1beta2",  
          "version": "v1beta2"
        } 
      ], 
     },
....
```

Make the API calls with `kubectl` (recommended) or use `curl` or other program providing the certificates, keys, and JSON string or file when required.

```bash
curl --cert userbob.pem \
  --key userBob-key.pem \ 
  --cacert /path/to/ca.pem \
  https://k8sServer:6443/api/v1/pods
```

It's important to check authorizations. Use `kubectl` to check authorizations as administrator and as a regular user (i.e. bob) in different namespaces:

```bash
$ kubectl auth can-i create deployments
yes

$ kubectl auth can-i create deployments --as bob
no

$ kubectl auth can-i create deployments --as bob --namespace developer
yes
```

There are 3 APIs which can be applied to set who and what can be queried:

- `SelfSubjectAccessView`: Access view for any user, useful for delegating to others.
- `LocalSubjectAccessReview`: Review is restricted to a specific namespace
- `SelfSubjectRulesReview`: A review shows allied actions for a user in a namespace

The use of `reconcile` allows a check of authorization necessary to create an object from a file. No output means the creation would be allowed.

As mentioned before the serialization for API calls must be JSON, all files in YAML are converted to and from JSON.

The value of `resourceVersion` is used to determine API updates and implement optimistic concurrency which means an object is not locked from the rime it has been read until the object is written.

The `resourceVersion` is backed via the `modifiedIndex` parameter in etc and it's unique to the namespace, kind and server. The operations that do not modifiy an object such as WATCH and GET, do not modify this value.

**Annotations** allow to add metadata to an object, they are key to value maps. Annotations can store more information and in human-readable format, labels are not.
